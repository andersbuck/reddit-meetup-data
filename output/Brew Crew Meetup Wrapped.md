Since this is the last meetup of the year I did a Brew Crew Meetup Wrapped! Enjoy!

In 2022 we really got together with 43 meetups total! We also had lots of variety going to 23 unique breweries!

Our most visited breweries this year (All tied at 3 visits) were:

* Birdsong
* Devil's Logic
* HopFly
* Resident Culture
* Town

And our highest upvoted meetup was ["Brew Crew Meetup: 2/8 @ Birdsong"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/snl87m/brew_crew_meetup_28_birdsong_630_pm/) with a score of 42 upvotes!

This year the comments were plentiful with 334 to be exact! And 6 users posted that they were joining for the first time!

Let's try this again! Going to head to Divine Barrel tonight at 6:30 until they close at 9.  I am quite confident there is no movie event tonight and they're website even says Music Trivia at 7! 

Will be quite chilly out so dress warm in case we congregate outside.  As usual we'll update where we're sitting.  There's a tiny parking lot in front but extra parking on Anderson and in the gravel lot across the way.  

Food truck onsite as well that should be open.

Trying something new as well but for those who cannot make it, next week we'll be looking to go to Sycamore (unless they too, are closed for movie night).

See ya there!

It's 2-22-22 today.  Spooky! Coincidence it happens to fall on a Tuesday as well? Who knows...but to celebrate this momentous occasion we're off to Town Brewery tonight.  Swing on by if you're in the area! Plenty of parking in that big gravel lot and if the weather is in the high 60s as expected, we'll be outside.

Pretty sure they have a kitchen onsite, plus their beer isn't too shabby.

After a holiday refresher, back at it this evening to Town Brewery on the west side of town.

Hoping the temps are like yesterday and it's a pleasant evening to come on out, sip on their delicious beers, finally discuss the ending to Stranger Things and end it with a good old fashioned tickle fight.  Wait what?


If you're new to the area  - there's dozens of you! - live nearby, then head on over!

Town has food onsite, Rhino Market next door and some eateries nearby.  

Will update where we're out but hopefully sitting outside. 

See you then!

This week off to one of my personal favorites, Catawba Brewery! Located near the heart of Plaza Midwood, it's a good low key spot with a nice patio, great view of the skyline and a good, diverse selection of beers styles + seasonals.

Unfortunately their site/social media a little lackluster in terms of other offerings but if anyone knows of any specials they're running sound off below! Sometimes they had food trucks there but I would plan to eat before coming for sure.

Parking on the street if the lot is full but plan to be out there starting at 6:30.

See you there!

Back out to Blue Blaze next week.

Come say goodbye to spooky szn at the aptly name Devils Logic.  A great spot close to uptown with plenty of good brews on tap, an in house kitchen (dominoes next door if that's not your jam) and one of my favorite rooftop views in the city!

Will be there around 6:30 pm, someone will update where we are - most likely biggest group there and on the rooftop deck if it's open - so hopefully you can come out! There's a tiny lot out back but most parking is across 4th street in the parking garage...and it's free!

This is also the last one before it's dark out early so enjoying those last bits of sunlight and sunsets for a while.

By request we're off to OMB this week for the first time in ages. Everyone's favorite brewery on here!

Weather looks wonderful so likely will be inside huddled up but who knows, maybe it won't rain and maybe it won't be crowded.

Lots of beers and food there, and parking can be iffy with all the other breweries in the area so if you cannot find a spot out back, street parking is your friend.

Come by if you're up for it.   Next week is the last one of the year (will pick back up in mid-January) and the plan for now is HopFly.

See you out there!

Celebrating the beginning of a new month with a trip out to Resident Culture in Plaza Midwood! 

Weather should be nice a cool so will probably be outside but as usual will update where we are sitting.  Parking is iffy in the main lot but some side streets nearby if you need them.  They usually have a food truck onsite and a pizza place a few doors down if you're hungry.

Wooden Robot on deck this week so brave the crowds and come on out to South End!

They have a run club starting at 6:30 and then trivia at 7 so trying to arrive at that sweet spot between both events. 

The weather will get nasty this afternoon so should clear up this evening.  Will plan to be outside if so.

Come on out if you're in the area! Close to the light rail and will be there until 9/9:30 or so.

This week we're gonna hop on over to HopFly Brewery (ha, get it? Hop? I'll show myself out).  

Located in the Brewery formerly known as Unknown, it's brand new to the Gold District area.  Have read some good things about it so far, only been open for about 3 weeks.  

It's right on Mint Street, about a half mile or so from Bank of America Stadium.  Unfortunately I do not know their food situation (someone who has been, feel free to chime in!), but maybe they'll have a food truck or allow you to bring in food from outside (Seoul kitchen down the road). 

Parking may be iffy since there's like 23 new bars/restaurants nearby but HopFly does have a small lot to the right of their building, otherwise will need to find street parking off Mint Street.  

Will try to go upstairs to their rooftop area if open but if not will plan to be outside on the patio since it should be pleasant outside today and won't be dark early!  Either way, will update where we're at.

If you're in the area or looking for something to do, swing on by! There until closing. 

Thanks!

Your eyes don't deceive you, for this week we're temporarily ditching the whole brewery aspect and trying something new!  From a request, we're off to try this Charlotte Beer Garden location.

Located in the land of salmon colored shorts and rompers, Charlotte Beer Garden offers a challenge of conquering 3 different levels to become ultimate beer champion (checks notes)....wait, sorry.  It's just 3 story bar.  Sorry, no challenges unless you wanna go for it yourself, then you do you.


But in all seriousness this place is 3 stories tall, has 100+ taps from all sorts of craft beers (and Bud Light if you're into that sort of thing).

Weather looks like it will clear up by this evening so would eventually plan to make it to their rooftop area, but for now meet on the first level and work our way up.

They have food there but I think you need to sit to be served.

Parking? No clue! It's South End...it's like the wild west of parking.   If you cannot find a street spot a few blocks away or are taking the light rail in, I know of a paid garage behind Stir that's close by.  

This is my first time there so if anyone has any suggestions/recommendations chime in below!

See you out there!

This week we're back at Divine Barrel! Located on the far reaches of NoDa, past the train tracks, it's apparently everyone's (read: reddit's) favroite brewery.

Good news for music lovers and fans of empanadas, there's both music bingo tonight and an empanada food truck according to their 'gram.

We'll be outside most likely since for once rain is not in the forecast but as usual someone will update or look for the people you'd THINK look like reddit people.

This week trying something new: bhramari brewery in the Gold District.  Located near Palmer/Mint, it's kind of tucked away.  This may not be an original Charlotte brewery (has a spot in Asheville), but have heard good things and excited to check it out!

Haven't been to that building in ages but from what I recall there was a decent amount of street parking and a large lot out back.  

Someone will have to chime in on their experiences plus any recommendations for beers/food.

New(ish) year, new(ish) you! Meetups are back tonight, January 25th at the new Midnight Mulligan Brewery on the west side of town. Will be there around 6:30 pm.

  Located next to Summit Seltzery, it's the perfect blend of.....something. I don't know, never been myself, but heard good things.  You can bring beers to Summit and vice versa so if you're looking for something a little lighter to drink, you got options! No idea on the food situation but there looks to be a parking lot to the side of the building.

This week off to Triple C, deep in the heart of South End.  Always a low key favorite of mine - and definitely not because I used to live next door - it's got a good ambiance, solid rotation of classic beers and always mixing in something new.

Let's show Midnight Mulligan the best way to attract patrons to their bar.  Who needs hot chicks, when you can put a bunch of thirsty (in more ways than one) redditors on their balcony.  What patron would deny that appeal? Didn't need a marketing degree for that one. #topical

Anyway Midnight Mulligan is a low key good spot.  nice views, ample parking, solid brews, selzters next door, and food!

Come on out and tell some spooky stories as we wrap up October.

Come celebrate the last dark meetup until the fall! This week we're going to check out the new Gilde Brewery.  Located in that weird no mans land between South End and Lower South End, it's supposed to be a true, authentic German beer experience.

Website is here and while there's food and sit down, we'll most likely be at the bar or outside standing depending on weather.  Parking seems iffy so be prepared if you're driving in, otherwise light rail or shared rides are best option.

Come out as we say goodbye to it being dark out so early on Tuesdays and look forward to spring arriving!

Will update where we're sitting/standing upon arrival.

Toodles.

Sorry all it's like a restaurant so not really optimal for our situation. Looks cool though.

Parking also sucks with all the construction, so I wound up parking in the apartment parking deck about 100 yards down the road.",Charlotte,"Brew Crew Meetup: 3/8 @ Gilde Brewery, 6:30 pm",0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/t9ggo0/brew_crew_meetup_38_gilde_brewery_630_pm/

Auto Mod is dead...for now.


So come out to celebrate his demise this evening with a couple of brews at Devils Logic! This weather should ease up this afternoon and the cloud cover this evening should be a small reprieve from the heat.

We'll be out there somewhere (either inside or on the rooftop deck as usual) sipping some cold beers, laughing about that time Auto Mod tried to  go to Skynet on us all and reminiscing about the good old days.

If you're in the area, looking for something to do and want to feel like you're melting being outside, then come on by. 

There's parking in a small lot behind the brewery, along with the parking deck directly across the street (be wary it's quite dangerous running across 4th street). They have a small kitchen onsite too if you're hungry. 

Will update where we're at. Stay cool!

This week off to Lower Left Brewery near OMB/Sugar Creek in (sighs) the LoSo region.  

Head on out - weather be damned! - if you're in the area tonight or looking for some cool vibes on a summer Tuesday.

Their space is quite small inside so will likely be outside.  Parking is also limited in their lot out back but some street parking in and around the area too.

Hope to see you out there!


Next week: HopFly in South End area

Off to Resident Culture in Plaza Midwood this evening! If you like delicious beers, swing on by! We'll be outside sweating profusely and laughing about it, starting at 6:30 pm.  Usually there until closing time too so if you're running late, no worries!

I believe they have a food truck onsite still plus a local pizza place down the road if you come hungry.  Parking on their lot is also super hit or miss (mostly miss cause there's like 5 spots) but there's overflow parking nearby and on the street if you can find some.

Apparently they're filming something in the area (hopefully not another Morris Jenkins commercial) so I expect some congestion getting in and out of the area.  


Hope to see you out there and hopefully no storms! Stay thirsty.

Next week: Planning on Lower Left near OMB for the spot (subject to change)

Up next on this week's rotation, Heist Barrel Arts! The one near camp north end, NOT the OG one in NoDa.

We'll be up there enjoying the refreshing fall air, sipping their beers, eating their food (pretty decent menu I might add if you come hungry) and trying to see if the mayor strolls through again like last time (hint: probably not).

Come swing by if you live up that way or looking for something to do tonight or....hear me out, looking to meet people cause it's hard and the 194955 posts made about meeting friends here seem to indicate that.  

Will update where we're at!
